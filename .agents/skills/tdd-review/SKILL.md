description: Check a completed feature or bugfix for missing tests, security issues, bugs, or performance issues (standalone version of the end-of-feature check)
---

This is the standalone version of the check that normally runs at the end
of `tdd-start` — use it when that step got skipped, or when re-running it
later on something already done.

## Determine scope

Ask, via a structured choice tool if one is available, otherwise as plain
text (and wait for the reply), what to review:
- Uncommitted changes (`git diff` / `git status`)
- The most recent commit (`git show` / `git log -1`)
- Everything since branching from the base branch (e.g. `git diff
  main...HEAD`)
- A specific file or directory to be named

If "a specific file or directory" is picked, ask for the path before
continuing.

Derive a `scope` key from the choice, for the shared findings store:
- Uncommitted changes -> `diff:uncommitted`
- The most recent commit -> `diff:last-commit`
- Everything since branching -> `diff:since-main`
- A specific file/directory -> `file:<path>` (the path as given)

## Run the check

Once the scope is settled, read `.agents/docs/tdd-review-checklist.md` and
follow it, scoped to what was determined above (the whole repo only if
that's genuinely what was picked), passing the `scope` key derived above.
A chosen finding becomes the next `tdd-start` feature — hand it off as the
feature name; don't start writing code in this skill.
