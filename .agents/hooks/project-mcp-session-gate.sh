# PreToolUse hook (matcher: Bash, Read). Blocks cold source-code exploration
# — grep/rg/ag/find/cat over the codebase, or Read of a .py file — until
# project-mcp has been consulted at least once this session.
#
# Why this exists: the TTL-gated hooks (project-mcp-reminder.sh /
# project-mcp-mark-consulted.sh) only fire on outside-in-tdd's TDD
# decision-point tools (init_feature, write_test, write_code, ...). Nothing
# stopped Claude from reaching for Bash(ls/grep/find) or Read to explore the
# codebase cold at the very start of a session, before any TDD tool — and in
# practice it did exactly that. This hook closes that gap.
#
# Deliberately coarse compared to the TTL gate: it only checks whether
# project-mcp has EVER been consulted this session (see
# .project-mcp-session-consulted, written once and never deleted by
# project-mcp-mark-consulted.sh), not whether the consult was fresh for this
# specific step. Once you've made one project-mcp call, exploration is
# unrestricted for the rest of the session — the goal is just to stop the
# "start cold with grep" pattern, not to gate every Read/Bash call forever.
#
# Classification is necessarily a heuristic since PreToolUse matchers can't
# filter by command text or file path — only by tool name. So this script
# parses tool_input itself:
#   - Bash: gated only if the command contains grep, rg, ag, find, or cat as
#     a whole word (i.e. actually invokes one of those tools, not just
#     mentions the word). Plain `ls`, git commands, test runs, etc. pass
#     through ungated — those aren't the cold-exploration pattern this
#     guards against.
#   - Read: gated only for .py files (this project's v1 scope is Python +
#     Django). Config, docs, and non-Python reads pass through.
